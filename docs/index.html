<BIG><BIG><B>The Gumowski / Mira formula and
Simulation</B></BIG></BIG><BR>
By: Stephen C. Ferguson, January 25, 2000<BR>
<P>
A formula is named after the two Physicists (or mathematicians) that discovered
it. Their names are Gumowski and Mira. &nbsp;They did experiments at the
CERN research facility in Geneva Switzerland. &nbsp;They were trying to calculate
(or simulate) the trajectories of elementary particles like protons that
move at high speeds in an accelerator, a circular channel with the diameter
of a tin can but several meters long. Gumowski and Mira used the formula
to simulate the orbits of the particles.
<P>
One of the formulas that they used is as follows:<BR>
<BR>
X(n+1) = B*Y + F(X)<BR>
Y(n+1) = -X + F(X(n+1))<BR>
<BR>
The function "F" is considered their model. &nbsp;One of the main functions
they used for their model is:<BR>
<BR>
F(X) = A*X + (1-A)*2*X*X/(1+X*X)
<P>
in which "A" is a parameter to be chosen freely and is usually anywhere in
the range of -1 to 1.&nbsp;"B" is a very sensitive constant and usually stays
at a value that is very close to 1.000. &nbsp;If the constant "B" is slightly
increased to a value of 1.001, then the trajectory will usually expand (or
spiral outward to infinity). If the constant "B" is slightly decreased to
something like a value of "0.999", then the trajectory will contract (or
spiral inward) towards the attractor points.<BR>
<BR>
Another very important parameter is the initial starting point of the trajectory.
This is sometimes called the "Seed" value. &nbsp;The seed is represented
by the initial values of X and Y. &nbsp;Typical initial values of X and Y
can be somewhere in the range of -20 to 20.
<P>
For "A=1", F(x) reduces to X. The model (F) is then completly regular, all
is stable, and chaos is absent. As A deviates more from 1, more chaos will
occur and the computer pictures get more interesting.
<P>
In summary, the formula can be written as follows:
<P>
X(n+1) = B*Y + F(n)<BR>
Y(n+1) = -X + F(X(n+1))
<P>
where: F(n) = A*X + (1 - AA)*2*X*X) / (1 + Y*Y)
<P>
For programming purposes, this formula can be written as follows:
<P>
T = X<BR>
X = B*Y + W<BR>
W = A*X + (1 - A)*2*X*X/(1 + X*X)<BR>
Y = W - T
<P>
The trajectories are then plotted on a 2 dimensional graph. The graph coordinates
usually range from about -20 to 20 in the X axis and -20 to 20 in the Y axis.
<P>
The following are some images and that were&nbsp;created using this method:

  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P ALIGN=Left>
In the above image, the value of B is 1.000. &nbsp;The orbit seems to fall
into a pattern of stability after several thousand iterations.

      B = 0.999900000</TD>

</TABLE>
<P>
In the above image, the "B" parameter is equal to 0.9999, and the trajectory
contracts (spirals inward) towards the attractor points which is represented
by the light (white) color. &nbsp;For this image there are five atrractor
points.<BR>

The above image shows a trajectory that is expanding to infinity. Note the
value of B = 1.00001<BR>
